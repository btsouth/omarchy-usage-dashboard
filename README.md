# Agent Pulse for Omarchy

[![Checks](https://github.com/btsouth/omarchy-usage-dashboard/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/btsouth/omarchy-usage-dashboard/actions/workflows/check.yml)

Token trends, account comparisons, usage limits, estimated API value, and reset notifications for AI coding agents — all counted locally. Includes a bar widget with live limit meters that opens the full dashboard.

## Install

Requires Omarchy 4 with Quickshell, Python 3.11+, and a systemd user session. Older Waybar-based versions are not supported.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btsouth/omarchy-usage-dashboard/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --with-plugin
```

Drop `--with-plugin` for the dashboard without the bar widget. To pin a release, pass the ref to Bash after the pipe: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btsouth/omarchy-usage-dashboard/main/install.sh | OMARCHY_USAGE_REF=v1.7.0 bash -s -- --with-plugin`. Installing from a checkout also works:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/btsouth/omarchy-usage-dashboard.git
cd omarchy-usage-dashboard
python3 install.py --with-plugin
```

Open the new bar widget and click **Open analytics**, or search for **Agent Pulse** in your application menu. Both open the same dashboard.

### Using it instead of the built-in widget

The installer adds **Agent Pulse** alongside Omarchy's built-in **Agents** widget. It does not automatically replace it, and it says so when another installed widget serves the same job, naming the plugin it found.

For a single AI icon, remove the old Agents widget from your bar layout after installing. Keep the new Agent Pulse widget: it covers Codex, Claude, and Fireworks like the built-in one (Fireworks starts off; enable it in Settings), and adds the providers, ordering, launch commands, and notifications described below. Omarchy's packaged files are unchanged, and you can add the original widget back later.

If the new widget does not appear, run:

```sh
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
```

The icon appears once recorded usage is available. You can open the dashboard from the application menu at any time. Large histories may take longer on the first scan.

### Dashboard without a bar widget

Use `python3 install.py` without `--with-plugin`. Open it from the application menu or run:

```sh
~/.local/bin/omarchy-usage-dashboard
```

Both install options run without sudo and keep working if you move or delete the checkout. See [installation details](docs/installation.md) for file locations.

## Features

- A live Today count that checks local agent histories every 15 seconds while the panel or dashboard is open and rolls up to each newly recorded total, plus exact hourly totals and source segments.
- 7-day, 30-day, 90-day, and yearly trends, with a daily chart and a full-screen breakdown.
- Input, output, and cache totals, estimated API value, and provider comparisons.
- Breakdowns by model, project, client, model provider, account, and session.
- Named accounts with multiple history folders and deduplication of copied records.
- Synced machine ledgers: one shared folder, with each machine importing the others so all stats appear in one dashboard.
- Available usage limits, up to three limits you can pin to the panel and dashboard overview, optional monthly plan prices, and Omarchy theme colors.
- Desktop notifications when a weekly or monthly limit resets or banked reset credits arrive, with the provider's own mark on the popup.
- A bar widget with the latest six hourly token totals, reset-aware limit meters, agent launch commands, and extra providers of your own.

The hourly bars show event-timed usage in your local time zone. Hour labels, reset times, and dashboard timestamps follow the 12- or 24-hour format selected for Omarchy's bar clock. Hermes reports accumulating session totals without request timestamps. Those tokens remain in the day total and are shown separately as having no exact hour. Agent Pulse checks local histories every 15 seconds while a view is open. Counts advance when an agent records usage, usually after a model response, rather than estimating tokens mid-stream. The full history, synced ledgers, and provider limits still refresh on their normal schedule. The dashboard starts on Today. Source, account, and model controls live under Filters, while Settings separates sources, accounts, pricing, sync, and appearance.

To keep limits visible, open each source in the bar panel and choose **Pin** beside a limit. Up to three pins appear together on the panel's main view and at the top of the dashboard, each with its usage and reset time. **Unpin** removes one limit. The panel also shows three separate "Limits to watch" suggestions, with all reset times above the hourly history.

## Bar widget settings

The widget reads its settings from its entry in `bar.layout` in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, alongside the settings panel's own keys:

```json
{
  "id": "community.ai-usage-dashboard",
  "providerOrder": ["codex", "commandcode", "clinepass"],
  "extraProviders": ["codex-second"],
  "launchCommands": { "codex": "codex", "commandcode": "command-code" }
}
```

- **providerOrder** sets the order the bar and panel walk providers in. Ids not listed follow alphabetically, so an agent nobody listed still appears.
- **extraProviders** admits providers the dashboard does not collect itself. Write an upstream-format record named `<id>.json` into `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/` — the same directory Omarchy's collectors use — and the widget picks it up, with the record's own `name` as its label. Whoever writes the record owns the collecting.
- **launchCommands** maps a provider id to the command right-click launches in a terminal. Providers without an entry fall back to Omarchy's agent picker.
- **alwaysShow** keeps a provider on the bar before it has numbers. Unlike the keys above it lives in the settings panel's own map, per provider: `settings.providers.<id>.alwaysShow`, not a top-level key.

## Reset notifications

After every refresh, the dashboard compares each provider's limits against the previous run and sends a desktop notification when a weekly or monthly window resets — or when banked reset credits arrive, which is how Codex delivers dropped resets. Short windows never notify: a label shaped in minutes or hours, or named a session, is excluded. Alerts cover Codex and Claude by default; adding a provider to the dashboard never silently opts it in. Extend the list by running the notifier yourself with more providers:

```sh
~/.local/bin/omarchy-usage-dashboard-notify-resets --provider commandcode
```

When an external Codex collector supplies a `resetCreditsAvailable` field, the dashboard refresh checks it against that card's Codex account using the local `auth.json`. The token is sent only to ChatGPT's credit endpoint. A failed check leaves the count unknown until the next successful refresh rather than showing an old credit. The panel also shows when the earliest unspent credit expires.

Claude's banked resets are added to the Claude card the same way. Anthropic's usage endpoint only lists them for a current Claude Code CLI, so the refresh asks as the installed `claude` version, using the sign-in Claude Code already saved. The token is sent only to Anthropic's usage endpoint. The answer is reused for five minutes because the endpoint rate-limits quickly, and the panel shows when an unspent reset expires.

## Supported sources

| Source | Token history | Usage limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | CLI and Codex desktop, including archives | From Omarchy |
| Claude Code | Project transcripts | From Omarchy |
| Grok Build | Completed turns and model calls | From the existing Grok login |
| Gemini CLI | Sessions and subagents | When an Omarchy snapshot is available |
| OpenCode Go | Requests through `opencode-go` | From the existing OpenCode connection |
| OpenCode | Other model providers used through OpenCode | Not collected |
| Pi / Oh My Pi | Saved assistant usage | Not collected |
| Muse | Completed model responses, including subagents | From the existing Muse login |
| Ollama Cloud | T3 Code, Hermes agent sessions, and background work | From an Ollama Cloud API key |
| CommandCode | T3 Code, Hermes agent sessions, and Command Code CLI transcripts | From a CommandCode API key: plan windows and the extra-credit balance |
| ClinePass | T3 Code and Hermes agent sessions | From a ClinePass API key |
| Cursor | Cloud usage events (tokens and list-price cost per model) | Billing-cycle usage from your Cursor sign-in |
| Hermes (OpenCode Go, Ollama Cloud, CommandCode, ClinePass) | Agent sessions, including background work | Not collected; adds to the cards for those routes |

Sources with recorded history appear automatically on a fresh install. Use **Settings** to choose which ones to show. OpenCode Go uses your existing API key; no cookie setup is needed. If Grok authentication expires, run `grok login`. Ollama Cloud, CommandCode, and ClinePass may need a key: type it in **Settings**, export `OLLAMA_API_KEY` / `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY` / `CLINE_API_KEY`, or put it in `~/.config/omarchy/ai-usage/ollama.key` / `commandcode.key` / `clinepass.key` (the key file an Ollama CLI install would use is also read, if one exists).

T3 Code's custom provider instances are discovered from `~/.t3/userdata/settings.json`. Their isolated Codex, Claude, and OpenCode histories are read in place, and a CommandCode runtime is attributed to the CommandCode card rather than to Codex.

Hermes records its own per-route totals, and OpenCode Go reaches the same account through two apps now. Both are counted: OpenCode's transcripts carry the per-request detail from the OpenCode client, and Hermes sessions are added from its own ledger. The two share no session or message ids, so nothing is double counted, and the added total reconciles to the agent's own ledger exactly. Hermes rows can additionally be split by what they were for (typed prompts versus title generation, compression, vision, approvals, and background review) in the client breakdown.

Normal ChatGPT, Grok web, and Gemini web conversations are not included. Copilot, Windsurf, and Antigravity are not supported. See [provider coverage](docs/provider-coverage.md) for formats and validation limits.

## Multiple accounts

Under **Settings → Accounts**, add a name and one or more agent home folders, such as `/mnt/work/.codex` and `/mnt/work/.claude`. Filter by account or use the Accounts breakdown to compare them.

Folders must already be available locally or mounted. The dashboard does not sync files. Copied records count once; conflicting account assignments are flagged.

Account labels group history, not credentials. **All accounts** shows the current login's quota on this PC, and a labelled account whose usage record carries the same id or name shows its own limits beside it. The source comparison keeps each labelled account separate. The hourly chart uses source colors, while the daily chart shows the filtered total. Optional monthly prices apply to the local history group when set on a provider, or to one account when set on its label; imported history never inherits the local price. See [account setup](docs/accounts.md).

## Understanding the numbers

- **Processed tokens** count reused context on every request. They are not a count of unique text.
- **API value** uses recorded estimates or catalog prices. OpenCode Go follows the documented model rates, including peak-hour doubling for DeepSeek and the per-model monthly allowances shown on the Go card. Ollama Cloud and CommandCode follow their own published rates, each including that provider's peak window for the DeepSeek models. ClinePass follows the reference rates its own documentation publishes for a flat-rate subscription. It is not your subscription bill. Missing prices stay marked as unpriced.
- **Per-session averages** cover recorded activity in the selected period. A session is not a completed task or a model-efficiency benchmark.
- **Models** are counted once per model across the routes that served it, so a model reached through more than one provider is a single row. Its detail shows the split by route and the model string each route recorded. Prices are unaffected: every route's tokens are priced at that route's own rates and then added up.
- **Filter by model** under Filters to narrow the whole page to one model, across every route that served it. The summary, chart, source comparison, breakdown table, and Go allowance then describe only that model. A Models-table row also opens that model's sessions. Changing the period keeps the model filter.
- **Exclude a source** under Filters to leave its history out of the view. The summary, chart, source comparison, and every breakdown update together. This is a view filter only: Settings controls visible providers and optional quota collection. Local transcript history continues to be indexed during scans. Use the source picker to focus on one source. Choosing **All sources** clears source exclusions and shows every enabled source again; other filters stay in place.

History refreshes every 15 minutes, along with OpenCode Go, Ollama Cloud, CommandCode, ClinePass, and enabled Grok quota. **Refresh** also requests fresh Codex and Claude limits from Omarchy. See [pricing details](docs/pricing.md) for rates and accounting.

Reports are generated locally. Provider quota requests and Cursor history requests contact the provider using your existing credentials. Optional ledger sync writes counters and source paths into the folder you choose, which your sync software may transfer to another machine. See [network and privacy details](docs/provider-coverage.md#network-and-privacy). The ledger stores counters, model names, project paths, session IDs, and timestamps. It does not copy conversation bodies or credentials. There is no telemetry.

## Update

Re-run the install command to update:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btsouth/omarchy-usage-dashboard/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --with-plugin
```

From a checkout, use `git pull --ff-only` and `python3 install.py --with-plugin` instead. Omit `--with-plugin` if you installed without the bar widget. Updates preserve your history and preferences.

The updater refuses to overwrite a file you have edited yourself, and stops before changing anything else, so one local edit blocks the whole update. It names the file it stopped on. Move that file aside and re-run:

```sh
mv ~/.local/share/omarchy-usage-dashboard/app/collector.py ~/collector.py.mine
```

The update then completes and installs the current copy. Your version stays where you moved it, so you can compare or reapply it.

## Uninstall

Quit the dashboard with **Ctrl+Q**, then run from the checkout or the archive:

```sh
python3 install.py --uninstall
```

This removes the managed installation and stops its timer. Your usage history and preferences remain. If you removed the built-in Agents widget from your bar, add it back through your bar layout settings.
