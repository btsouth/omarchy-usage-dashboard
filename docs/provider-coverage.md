# Provider coverage

This dashboard measures recorded coding activity. A source is the app that saved a request, not necessarily the company serving its model. Native Codex/Claude usage is separate from OpenCode and Pi. The Routes table shows the underlying provider when the app records it. OpenCode Go is excluded from general OpenCode totals.

## Supported history

| Source | Default location | Accounting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions`, `~/.codex/archived_sessions`, plus enabled T3 Code Codex instances | Cache reads are part of input; reasoning is part of output. Repeated cumulative snapshots and inherited fork history are deduplicated. |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects`, plus enabled T3 Code Claude instances | Stream updates merge by message/request ID. Cache writes are separate from input; one-hour writes are a subset of cache writes. |
| Grok Build | `~/.grok/sessions/**/updates.jsonl` | Completed-turn model usage takes precedence over the aggregate. Stable event IDs deduplicate copied history. Reasoning is part of output. Turns without detailed usage are excluded. |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats` | Legacy JSON, current JSONL, and nested subagent files. Stable message IDs deduplicate migrations and updates. Thinking is added to output. Tool-prompt tokens are added only when the reported total confirms they are separate. |
| OpenCode / Go | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, `storage/message`, plus enabled T3 Code OpenCode data homes | Read-only database access and legacy message files. Stable message IDs merge migrated copies. Go, Ollama Cloud, and ClinePass use their own provider IDs; other routes remain under OpenCode. Reasoning is added to output. |
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/sessions` | Assistant message usage across all saved branches. Entry IDs plus original timestamps deduplicate copied branches. Cache counters are separate; reasoning is part of output. |
| Oh My Pi | `~/.omp/agent/sessions` | The same usage categories as Pi, including current title-slot session files. Kept separate from Pi. |
| Muse | `~/.local/share/muse/sessions` | Completed model responses (`model_completed` events) across dated and subagent session files. The retained-frame envelope is unwrapped; duplicate attribution rows are ignored. Reasoning is recorded separately and is not added to output. Responses without detailed usage are excluded. |
| Hermes (OpenCode Go, Ollama Cloud, CommandCode, ClinePass) | `~/.hermes/state.db` | The agent's own per-route totals from `session_model_usage`, read-only. Rows are keyed by session, model, route, and task, and the table accumulates in place, so a rescan updates a row rather than adding one. Counting starts at the row's first sighting, so an accumulating total never migrates to a later day and rewrites the daily history. Reasoning stays a separate column and is never added to output: Hermes stores the provider's completion_tokens, which already include it, unlike OpenCode's disjoint counter. The task dimension becomes the client label. |
| Cursor | Cloud DashboardService API (per-event tokens and list-price cost) | Requires the Cursor desktop app sign-in; the session token is read locally and never stored. Events carry per-model input, output, and cache-read tokens plus a list-price cost estimate — plan discounts are not applied per event, so the quota card's billed totals are authoritative. |

Settings accepts additional source folders, including already mounted copies from another computer. T3 Code provider instances are detected from `~/.t3/userdata/settings.json`; only their enabled runtime paths are read, never credentials stored beside them. Source variables `CODEX_HOME`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `GROK_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, and `MUSE_HOME` are respected. `CURSOR_HOME` selects the Cursor config root used for the local sign-in lookup. Custom session locations outside these roots must be placed within a configured source's expected directory structure.

OpenCode Go, Ollama Cloud, CommandCode, and ClinePass are the routes Hermes also bills, and it writes nothing to the CLI apps' own histories. CommandCode has two profiles for the same account and product, one OpenAI-shaped and one Anthropic-shaped; both collapse onto one card, with the raw route kept for the Routes breakdown. Their rows are therefore added alongside those routes. The two never describe the same request: OpenCode records one row per assistant message under its own session ids, while Hermes records one accumulated row per session, model, route, and task under its own ids. Because Hermes reports at session-and-task granularity, its rows count as usage records rather than per-request rows, and its `api_call_count` is shown as model calls where a card reports them.

Hermes stores no dollar estimate for these routes, so its rows price from the catalog exactly as OpenCode Go rows do, and stay marked unpriced where no rate exists.

## One row per model

The Models breakdown and the bar panel's model list answer one question per model, so a model reached over several routes is one row. The dashboard table carries its split by route, while the panel labels its total as covering all routes. Each route records the model string its own API returns: OpenCode Go and Ollama Cloud record a bare name, while CommandCode and ClinePass prefix it with the vendor's id. Those spellings are the same model, and the dashboard counts them together while preserving the recorded spelling on each route. A single-route row that was grouped under one name still shows the spelling it was recorded under.

The grouping is an explicit list of model strings, except for the narrow `muse-spark-*` family rule that removes a route's vendor prefix while retaining the model's version and tier. A general prefix rule is not used, so a model whose name merely looks similar is not folded in with another. Value is unaffected by grouping: every record is priced by its own route's rate table first, and the grouped row adds those figures up, so it shows the real total rather than one route's rates applied to another route's traffic. Pricing coverage is deliberately not grouped: it names the route and the exact recorded spelling, because that pair identifies the rate table that has not caught up.

A model selection follows the same grouping. Choosing a grouped row, or invoking `report --model` with any of the spellings it covers, selects the whole model rather than one route's share of it, and the per-card model rows respect exactly that selection. The other breakdowns (routes, projects, clients, sessions, accounts) stay per route, because a route is what they describe.

The dashboard offers that selection as a filter: a row of models under the accounts narrows the whole page without moving off it, and a Models-table row filters and then opens that model's sessions. Everything filtered is genuinely filtered: the summary, the previous-period comparison, the chart, the provider cards, the Go allowance card's model list, and every breakdown, because one selection is applied before any of them is accumulated. The list of models offered is deliberately not narrowed by the filter itself, or it would collapse to the entry already chosen and a model could not be swapped without clearing first; it does follow the period, a chosen day, the route tab, and the account filter.

A source can be left out the same way. The source row under the title switches one source's history out of the view, and `report --excludeSource <id>` does it for a scripted report; the source is dropped before anything is accumulated, so the summary, the cards, the model filter's own list, and every breakdown agree. This is a view filter and nothing more: settings control visible providers and optional quota requests, while local history remains indexed for later periods. Excluding a source also drops it from the Go allowance card and, when a row had drilled into that source, clears that scope rather than showing an empty page.

Gemini records identify projects by hash, so the dashboard labels them as Gemini project IDs. It does not guess the original filesystem path. Deleted or rewound conversation content does not refund tokens: already recorded usage stays in the metric ledger. Ephemeral sessions and calls that never write usage cannot be recovered.

## Limits and pricing

History and quota are independent. An expired login can stop quota updates while token history remains readable. Stale quota snapshots retain their timestamp and an error; absence is not treated as zero usage.

Codex and Claude use Omarchy quota snapshots. Grok and OpenCode Go have collectors in this package. Gemini can display an existing Omarchy snapshot. General OpenCode, Pi, and Oh My Pi can use several accounts and providers, so the dashboard does not assign them one quota or subscription price automatically. Muse quota (current session window and weekly allowance) is read from the existing Muse login and refreshed on scan. If the sign-in expires, run `muse login` to restore quota. Cursor quota comes from its billing-cycle summary; an expired sign-in keeps previous usage with an error.

Ollama Cloud usage is read from `GET https://ollama.com/api/usage` with an API key. This endpoint is not documented by Ollama and the web settings page is its only other consumer, so it can change or disappear; when it fails, the previous snapshot stays with its timestamp and an error, and nothing else in the dashboard is affected. The response reports a fraction of each plan window under `limits`, which the meter shows directly. Legacy plans carry a session window that resets every 5 hours and a weekly one; credit plans carry a monthly window. Only the windows a plan actually reports are shown, and the endpoint supplies no reset time, so those meters show a share without a countdown. It counts GPU time on request counts rather than tokens, so the Go card's value-against-allowance view does not apply here.

CommandCode usage is read from `GET https://api.commandcode.ai/alpha/billing/credits` and `/alpha/billing/subscriptions` with an API key, the same endpoints its own CLI uses. These are not documented for third parties and can change; when a call fails, the previous snapshot stays with its timestamp and an error, and nothing else in the dashboard is affected. The plan's allowance is measured in credit value, not tokens: GOAT allows $14 in any 5 hours, $35 in any 7 days, and $70 a month. Each window reports its own spend, cap, and reset time, so unlike the other providers these meters carry a countdown. The monthly cap is read as remaining credits plus what the period has spent, which the two endpoints agree on exactly, so a plan change needs no code change. Token history comes from T3 Code and Hermes sessions and from Command Code's own session transcripts, and is priced with CommandCode's resale rates, not the labs' list prices. Its key is read from Settings, `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY`, or `~/.config/omarchy/ai-usage/commandcode.key`.

ClinePass usage is read from `GET https://api.cline.bot/api/v1/users/me/plan/usage-limits` and `/users/me/plan` with a Cline API key, the endpoints its own dashboard uses. They are not documented for third parties and can change; when a call fails, the previous snapshot stays with its timestamp and an error, and nothing else in the dashboard is affected. The endpoints report a percentage of the plan's windows, a rolling five hours, the calendar week, and the calendar month, each with its own reset time, so these meters carry a countdown. The percentage is 0-100 at the endpoint and 0-1 in the snapshot, like every other provider's. Its key is read from Settings, `CLINE_API_KEY`, or `~/.config/omarchy/ai-usage/clinepass.key`. Token history comes from T3 Code and the Hermes ledger, so the card shows both runtimes' sessions on that route.

The Ollama Cloud key is read from Settings, then `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, then `~/.config/omarchy/ai-usage/ollama.key`, then the key file an Ollama CLI install writes (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/ollama/api_key`). It is never written anywhere but the settings file, never refreshed, and never leaves the request it authenticates. Reports the dashboard renders carry a mask in place of a stored key, and the settings channel masks it the same way, so no code path that a window or panel reads returns the secret itself. The quota cache throttles on a digest of the key, never the key.

Grok's completed-turn dollar estimate is used directly. Positive recorded API estimates from OpenCode/Pi/Oh My Pi take precedence over catalog prices. Otherwise exact catalog matches are used and missing prices remain unpriced. See [pricing policy](pricing.md).

## Other frequently requested sources

- **Copilot:** current CLI telemetry can expose token usage, but that requires telemetry collection rather than substituting premium requests or AI credits for tokens. IDE and CLI coverage must be distinguished.
- **Windsurf / Antigravity:** quota support alone would not establish complete per-request token history. Neither is advertised as a token-history integration here.
- **OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kimi, MiniMax, Z.ai, and other models through OpenCode/Pi:** their locally recorded usage is covered by the host app integration. That does not include API traffic from unrelated apps or establish account-wide balances.

## Validation

The new Gemini, Pi, and Oh My Pi parsers are tested against fixtures based on their public formats. There is no real history from those three apps on the development machine, so live session validation remains distinct from fixture coverage. Grok was reconciled against retained local events, including copied history. OpenCode Go and the two retained non-Go OpenCode messages were reconciled against the local database; multi-route and legacy migration behavior also has fixture coverage. Hermes-sourced rows were reconciled against the agent's own ledger totals for both routes to the token, and the two ledgers were confirmed to share no session ids. Cursor's cloud parser has fixture coverage only: the sample's key set is a redacted shape capture and every value in it is synthetic, so no real event, id, or token is committed.

A correction to the Hermes parser after its first release re-reads those rows once: the parser had added Hermes' reasoning count on top of output, which double counted because Hermes stores the provider's completion_tokens (reasoning is a subset there, unlike OpenCode's disjoint counter). It had also anchored each row at its last activity, which moved an accumulating total to a later day on every rescan and rewrote the daily history. Existing installs repair themselves on the next scan through a provenance version bump, which deletes and re-reads only the affected rows.

## Network and privacy

`collector.py report` reads the existing ledger without scanning transcripts, changing history, or making provider requests. Opening the dashboard, saving settings, the Refresh button, and the timer run collection separately. Demo mode uses synthetic history and does not make provider requests.

Runtime provider requests use these destinations:

- OpenCode Go: `opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage`.
- Grok: `grok.com/grok_api_v2.GrokBuildBilling/GetGrokCreditsConfig`.
- Muse: the API base configured by the local Muse login, defaulting to `api.meta.ai`, with `/muse-code/key`. Returned key material is discarded; only quota fields are cached.
- Ollama Cloud: `ollama.com/api/usage`.
- CommandCode: `api.commandcode.ai/alpha/billing/credits`, `/alpha/billing/subscriptions`, and `/alpha/usage/summary`.
- ClinePass: `api.cline.bot/api/v1/users/me/plan/usage-limits` and `/api/v1/users/me/plan`.
- Cursor: `api2.cursor.sh/aiserver.v1.DashboardService/GetCurrentPeriodUsage` and `GetFilteredUsageEvents`.

Credentials authenticate these requests in headers. Transcript bodies are not uploaded. The native Omarchy quota updater is a separate program invoked by Refresh and follows its own provider integrations. Installation downloads from GitHub; the optional maintainer pricing tools download the documented public catalogs. No telemetry endpoint is present.

Optional ledger sync exports metric counters, timestamps, model and session ids, project paths, and source provenance to the selected directory. A cloud or network sync service managing that directory can transfer those files. Leave ledger sync unset to keep those files local.

Cursor pulls at most 40 pages per scan. A capped pull is marked incomplete and resumes on the next scan; new arrivals are collected after that history range finishes. Pagination is timestamp-based because the endpoint has no stable event cursor in the captured format. More than one full page of distinct events at exactly the same millisecond cannot be proven complete with that interface. Cursor remains fixture-tested against an undocumented endpoint, not independently reconciled against a live account in this review.

Reset alerts default to Codex and Claude. For explicitly added providers, the notifier excludes labels containing session, minutes, or hours. Other labels, including Daily and Billing cycle, qualify. Overlapping runs are locked, but notification delivery is best effort: a desktop daemon failure or process termination between delivery and snapshot persistence cannot provide exactly-once delivery.
